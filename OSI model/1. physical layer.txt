#PYHSICAL LAYER

-You have Recive data in Frame in upper layer ther data is in bits from
     so this layer Converts bits into Electronic Signals for Outgoing messages.
-its Convert signals into bits and bits into signals.
-This layer manages the interface between the computre and the network 
     medium.(Coax,Twisted pair,Fiber)

#Services Provided by Physical layer
-Transmition Mode:-
             i)Siplex. ii)Half Duplex. iii)Full Duplex.
-Physical Characteristic of the media:-
             If Defind the type of the Media(Wired or wiredless) and Convert
       data like ther travel in ther conected mediam.
-Representation of bits:-
             Convert bits into signals encoding.
-Data rate:-
        The number of bits send each second.
-Synchronization of bits.
-Line Configuration:-
        It Configer  that this is point-to-point or Multipoint.
-Physical Topology:-
        Find Topology how data is Transfar.
