#HUB

-HUB connect computers in a star topology network.
-if any one computer send data packet on HUB then the HUB are
 send Ther data packet on all conected computers.
-it is not a smart Dives it has no any memory to sorege nodes address
 for shering data to parfect node thas way he send data all conected
 nodes. 

#SWITCH

-Switch provides a central Connection, Between two or more Computers(nodes)
 on Network.
-Switch has Inelligence becouse it has memory to store MAC Addresses of
 Connected nodes and the Help of MAC Address SWITCH nows witch data going
 to the witch Computer(node).

#ROUTER

-Router is Connect Defrant Types of Networks
  Ex:- Router Connect 2 LAN Networks each other.
-Router Operate at the layer 3 NETWORK LAYER of the OSI model and 
   efficienty Router information Between Local Area Networks.

#REPEATER

-Repetater is mostly used in wirlees deives and wirerd also.
-A repetater is an electronic Device that receives a signal and Retansmits
 it at a higher level and higher power on to the other side of an on struction,
 so that the singnal can cover longer distans.

#NIC

-A Network interface card is a computer hardware componet designed to 
 computers to communicate over a computer Network.
-NIC is embiild inyour pc your manufachurar is provides you a NIC with
 MAC Address.
-with the help of NIC you connect to the Network Ex: internet
-your pc MAC Addrass is store in NIC card.

#MODEM

-Modem(from Modularor-demodularor) is a device that truns the digital 1s and
 0s of a peronal computer into sound that can be transmitted over the telephone line.
-and one's received on the other side, convertd those sound back into a from used by
 a USB,Ethernet,Serial or Network Connection.
-Modems are Generally Classified by the amount of data they can send in a given time,
 Normally measured in bits per second, or "bps".

#BRIDGE

-Bridge is a itelligent repeter.
-Bridge have a one memory element that can Store bothe side of MAC Address.

EX:- if I have 2 sides Left-Right and in medal I connected Bridge to bothe
        side nodes.
- Then I want to send data on right side of number 3 pc and same time to send 
     data on also rigth side of pc number 1 then the Bridge is the dives that
     can send the data to right side to rigth side he cant travel data on left
     side thas way it is itelligent dives. 

#GATEWAYS

-Gateways is a software that is enbilled in Router.
-Some time we called GATEWAY AS PROTOCALL CONVERTER.
-Its helps to work Router.

#WIRELESS ACCESS POINT

-A Wireless Access Point (WAP or AP) is a Device that allows to communication
   wireless Network Using WI-FI,Bluetooth or related Standards.
